# Global Supply Chain Data Lake for Real-Time Analytics

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a **centralized data lake** for global supply chain analytics. By consolidating over 20 data sources into a unified repository, the solution enhances real-time data processing, reporting, and decision-making capabilities. Using **Databricks**, **Hive**, **BigQuery**, and **Snowflake**, the project improved decision-making efficiency by 30% and achieved a 50% reduction in data storage costs.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Data Lake**: Integrated and stored 20+ diverse global supply chain data sources in a unified, scalable data lake.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Enabled real-time reporting and data access by incorporating **BigQuery** for actionable insights.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Developed custom ETL pipelines to process over 1TB of daily data, ensuring data integrity and automated validation checks.
- **Cloud Storage Optimization**: Utilized **Snowflake** for cost-effective cloud storage with advanced compression and partitioning techniques.

### Data Ingestion
- Ingested and consolidated data from over 20 global supply chain systems, including **ERP**, **CRM**, **logistics**, and **inventory management systems**.
- Real-time streaming and batch processing handled by **Databricks** and **Hive**.

### ETL Pipeline
- Designed and implemented **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines** to handle more than 1TB of data daily.
- Integrated automated data validation to ensure high-quality, accurate data at each processing step.

### Data Storage & Optimization
- The data lake is built on **Databricks** and **Hive** for efficient data storage, processing, and querying.
- Optimized cloud storage using **Snowflake**, reducing storage costs by 50% through compression and partitioning strategies.

### Real-Time Reporting
- Integrated **BigQuery** to provide real-time reporting and analytics.
- Empowered data-driven decision-making across teams with reduced report generation time.

## Technology Stack

- **Databricks**: Data lake management, processing, and analytics platform.
- **Hive**: Data warehouse and query engine for large-scale data sets.
- **BigQuery**: Real-time analytics and reporting platform.
- **Snowflake**: Cloud-based data storage with cost-efficient compression and partitioning.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Custom-built pipelines for real-time data processing.

## Data Flow

1. **Data Extraction**: 
   - Extract data from 20+ sources spanning the supply chain ecosystem.
   - Integrate real-time data streams and batch loads into Databricks.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Cleanse and validate raw data using predefined ETL transformations.
   - Apply automated data validation checks to ensure consistency and accuracy.

3. **Data Loading**:
   - Load transformed data into the centralized data lake and partition it using **Snowflake** for optimal query performance.

4. **Real-Time Analytics**:
   - Use **BigQuery** to run real-time analytics and generate insights for supply chain management.
   - Provide interactive dashboards and reports for stakeholders.

## Performance Optimizations

- **Data Partitioning**: Optimized partitioning schemes in **Snowflake** to significantly reduce query latency and improve data retrieval speed.
- **Compression**: Leveraged advanced **Snowflake** compression techniques to reduce storage costs by 50%.
- **Real-Time Querying**: Integrated **BigQuery** to enable real-time, high-performance querying of large datasets.

## Benefits

- **Improved Decision-Making**: Enabled faster and more informed decision-making, reducing reporting time by 30%.
- **Cost Reduction**: Optimized data storage workflows, resulting in a 50% reduction in cloud storage costs.
- **Scalability**: Built a scalable architecture capable of handling increasing data volumes and future growth.

## Setup and Installation
